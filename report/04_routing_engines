\section{Routing Engines}
The Pelias API and Pelias services are only suited for the purpose of geocoding and reverse geocoding. Geocoding retrieves coordinates (latitude and longitude) for a given address or postode and reverse geocoding finds the nearest known address or postcode for a provided address.
In order to find the shortest or fastest route between two given addresses Pelias has to be used in conjunction with a routing engine. The two addresses are fed into Pelias and Pelias provides coordinates for them which are then used as input values for finding a route from one coordinate to the other using a routing engine and the metrics inside the routing engine.
