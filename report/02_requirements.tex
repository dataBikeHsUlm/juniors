\section{Requirements}
The main requirements were to evaluate Pelias as an open source geocoding service and as an alternative to Nominatim as well as to realize routing from one two-digit postcode to another. In order to achieve this it was necessary to build a database of postcodes and create a map of Europe based on data provided by Openstreetmaps, Whosonfirst, Geonames and Postcodeinfo. Furthermore, routing engines as an alternative to Graphhopper had to be evaluated. Last but not least an adequate documentation on how these requirements can be fulfilled and the outcome reproduced had to be written.
